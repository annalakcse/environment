<li>A carbon footprint is made up of the sum of two parts.
<li>1. The primary footprint is a measure of our direct emissions of CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels including domestic energy consumption and transportation (e.g. car and plane). We have direct control of these.
 <li>2. The secondary footprint is a measure of the indirect CO2 emissions from the whole lifecycle of products we use.
